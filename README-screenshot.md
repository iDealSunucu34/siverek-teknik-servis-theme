# Screenshot.png

A screenshot.png file should be added to the theme root directory.

**Requirements:**
- Dimensions: 1200x900 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Shows the theme's appearance
- Used in WordPress theme selector

**To create:**
Use any image editor to create a 1200x900px image showing the theme's design.

For now, WordPress will use a default placeholder until screenshot.png is added.
