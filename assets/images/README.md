# Assets Images Directory

This directory is for theme images and graphics.

## Recommended Structure:

- `/logos/` - Brand logos for service providers
- `/icons/` - Icon files and graphics
- `/placeholders/` - Placeholder images for development

## Image Optimization Guidelines:

1. **Format**: Use WebP for modern browsers with JPG/PNG fallback
2. **Compression**: Optimize all images before upload
3. **Sizing**: Provide multiple sizes for responsive images
4. **Naming**: Use descriptive, SEO-friendly filenames
5. **Alt Text**: Always include alt attributes for accessibility

## Lazy Loading:

All images should use the `loading="lazy"` attribute, which is automatically added by the theme.
